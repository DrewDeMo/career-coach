## 🔄 Modified Files

### `app/api/chat/route.ts`
**Changes**:
- Replaced simple `getUserContext()` with `getEnhancedUserContext()`
- Added conversation memory retrieval
- Integrated enhanced system prompt builder
- Updated entity extraction to work with scored items
- Increased max_tokens from 1000 to 1500 for richer responses

**Before vs After**:
```typescript
// BEFORE: Static context fetching
const context = await getUserContext(user.id)
const systemPrompt = buildSystemPrompt(context)

// AFTER: Intelligent, intent-based context
const enhancedContext = await getEnhancedUserContext(user.id, message)
const conversationMemory = await getConversationMemory(user.id)
let systemPrompt = buildEnhancedSystemPrompt(enhancedContext)
systemPrompt += buildMemoryContext(conversationMemory)
```
