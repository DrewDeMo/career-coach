## 📊 Architecture Overview

```
User Flow:
1. Sign up → Create account in Supabase Auth
2. Onboarding → Collect career data (3 steps: Profile, Skills, Goals)
3. Chat → AI coaching with context-aware responses
4. Profile → View/edit career information
5. Dashboard → Career insights and progress

Data Flow:
1. User sends message → Chat API
2. API retrieves relevant context from Supabase
3. Context + message → GPT-4o-mini
4. GPT response analyzed for updates
5. New information → Update Supabase tables
6. Response displayed to user
```

## 🔑 Key Features

## 📝 Implementation Notes

### Database
- Schema uses `role_title` instead of `current_role` (PostgreSQL reserved keyword)
- All tables have automatic `updated_at` triggers

- RLS policies ensure users can only access their own data

### Middleware
- Handles auth redirects automatically
- Checks for completed onboarding (career_profiles table)
- Redirects unauthenticated users to login
- Redirects authenticated users without profile to onboarding

### Onboarding
- 3-step wizard: Profile (required), Skills (optional), Goals (optional)
- Progress indicator shows current step
- Data saved to Supabase after each step
- Skip functionality for optional steps
- Auto-redirect to chat after completion

### Design
- Minimal black & white aesthetic
- Manrope font for modern typography
- Consistent 44px input heights
- Gray-50 backgrounds for form sections
- Hover effects on interactive elements
- Smooth transitions throughout

### Chat Interface
- Full-height layout with fixed header and input
- Messages displayed in scrollable center area
- User messages: black background, white text (right-aligned)
- Assistant messages: gray background, black text (left-aligned)
- Timestamps on all messages
- Animated typing indicator during AI response
- Auto-focus on input after sending
- Keyboard shortcuts (Enter to send, Shift+Enter for new line)

### AI System
- Context retrieval fetches: profile, top 10 skills, 5 active goals, 5 recent projects
- System prompt includes all user context for personalized responses
- GPT-4o-mini model for fast, cost-effective responses
