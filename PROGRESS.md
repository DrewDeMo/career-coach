## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Build Chat Interface** - Create the main coaching page with message UI
2. **Implement Chat API** - Set up `/api/chat` endpoint with GPT-4o-mini
3. **Context System** - Build smart context retrieval from Supabase
4. **Prompt Engineering** - Design effective system prompts
5. **Test Complete Flow** - Signup → Onboarding → Chat with AI

## 📊 Architecture Overview

```
User Flow:
1. Sign up → Create account in Supabase Auth
2. Onboarding → Collect career data (3 steps: Profile, Skills, Goals)
3. Chat → AI coaching with context-aware responses
4. Profile → View/edit career information
5. Dashboard → Career insights and progress

Data Flow:
1. User sends message → Chat API
2. API retrieves relevant context from Supabase
3. Context + message → GPT-4o-mini
4. GPT response analyzed for updates
5. New information → Update Supabase tables
6. Response displayed to user
```

## 🔑 Key Features

- **Context-Aware Coaching**: GPT knows about your career, projects, skills, goals
- **Automatic Updates**: System learns from conversations
- **Structured Data**: All career info organized in database
- **Smart Retrieval**: Only relevant context sent to GPT
- **Privacy First**: RLS ensures data isolation
- **Modern UI**: Clean, minimal 2025/26 design with Manrope font

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.5.6, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui (Button, Input, Label, Textarea, Select, Card, Progress)
- **Typography**: Manrope font family (200-800 weights)
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini
- **Auth**: Supabase Auth
- **Validation**: Zod, React Hook Form

## 📝 Implementation Notes

### Database
- Schema uses `role_title` instead of `current_role` (PostgreSQL reserved keyword)
- All tables have automatic `updated_at` triggers
- JSONB fields for flexible data storage (responsibilities, technologies, etc.)
- RLS policies ensure users can only access their own data

### Middleware
- Handles auth redirects automatically
- Checks for completed onboarding (career_profiles table)
- Redirects unauthenticated users to login
- Redirects authenticated users without profile to onboarding

### Onboarding
- 3-step wizard: Profile (required), Skills (optional), Goals (optional)
- Progress indicator shows current step
- Data saved to Supabase after each step
- Skip functionality for optional steps
- Auto-redirect to chat after completion

### Design
- Minimal black & white aesthetic
- Manrope font for modern typography
- Consistent 44px input heights
- Gray-50 backgrounds for form sections
- Hover effects on interactive elements
- Smooth transitions throughout

## 🚀 Current Status

**Ready for Chat Implementation** - The onboarding flow is complete and functional. Users can sign up, complete their profile, and are redirected to the chat page. The next step is to build the chat interface and integrate GPT-4o-mini for AI coaching conversations.

**Running on**: `localhost:3000`
**Database**: Supabase (configured and connected)
**Auth**: Fully functional with middleware protection
